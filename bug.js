This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `Linking.addEventListener` method may not trigger consistently, or it may fail to open the URL in a specific browser, or it may not trigger at all. This is particularly problematic in Android when using specific versions of Android, or in combination with certain custom configurations, leading to inconsistent behavior.
